## The Summarizing

# A project developed over ten nights as part of Code 4 All's Game's Week

We proudly present the game produced as part of the Code for All Games Week.
We were challenged to make a game in 10 nights, since we have classes during the day.
Through the companionship of the group, "The Summarizing" was born. 
An endless runner, completely made in Java, which challenges the code cadets to escape from their teachers and consequently from the dreaded Summarizer.
